# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

We will attempt to tackle the problem of trying to predict the price of Bitcoin using the graphical data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. The outcome for the project would be to approximate the future prices of bitcoin as close as possible. For this project we are planning on utilizing the Kaggle dataset and we will be extracting features from additional datasets and combine them with the Kaggle dataset and perform a large-scale data aggregation in order to predict the future prices. Such datasets that we will be using can be seen below.
